# Solutions Lookup

Reference skill. Consult `~/docs/solutions/` before starting non-trivial work — both coding AND operational tasks.

## When to Check

**Before coding:** Already covered by CLAUDE.md "Read before write" rule.

**Before operational/admin tasks (the gap this skill fills):**
- Filing insurance claims → check `operational/manulife-simpleclaim-gotchas.md`
- Medical appointments → check `operational/qhms-process.md`, etc.
- HR/resignation processes → check `operational/resignation-exit-tactics.md`
- Financial admin → check `operational/` for relevant entries
- Any task where Terry or Claude previously hit friction

## How to Search

Quick keyword search — no agents needed:

```bash
# By filename
ls ~/docs/solutions/ ~/docs/solutions/operational/ | grep -i "<keyword>"

# By content (scoped, fast)
rg -il "<keyword>" ~/docs/solutions/ --max-depth 2
```

## Directory Structure

```

├── operational/          # Day-to-day life/admin (insurance, medical, banking, HR)

## Routing New Learnings Here

| Type | Subdirectory |
|------|-------------|
| Insurance, medical, banking, HR, government | `operational/` |
| Coding tool gotcha | Root (`~/docs/solutions/`) |
| Reusable workflow pattern | `patterns/` |
| Browser automation | `browser-automation/` |

## Integration with Other Tools

- **km-ask** searches QMD (vault) → Oghma (conversations) but does NOT cover docs/solutions/
- **learnings-researcher** (compound-engineering) does search here but is heavy
- **This skill** = lightweight first-pass before either of those

## Key Rule

The "Read before write" principle applies to operational work too. Before handling an insurance claim, medical appointment, or HR process — check if we've already documented the gotchas.
