# Weekly Reset

Sunday ritual to review job search status and plan the week ahead.

## When to Use

- Every Sunday
- When Terry says "weekly reset" or "sunday reset"
- At natural week boundaries

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read Current State

Read these files to understand current status:
- `/Users/terry/notes/Job Hunting.md` — pipeline, networking, applications
- `/Users/terry/notes/CLAUDE.md` — for weekly reset format reference

### Step 2: Identify the Week

Determine the current week's date range (e.g., "Jan 19-25") and check if a weekly note exists:
- Look for `/Users/terry/notes/Week of [date range].md`
- If it exists, read it and update as needed
- If not, create it

### Step 3: Review & Present

Present a summary covering:

1. **Pipeline Status**
   - Interviews scheduled (with dates)
   - Awaiting responses
   - Recently applied (too early for signal)
   - Likely dead

2. **Networking Status**
   - Calls/meetings this week
   - Who's in motion
   - Who needs follow-up

3. **Follow-ups Due**
   - Applications to nudge
   - Contacts to check in with
   - Deadlines approaching

4. **Applications to Send**
   - "Noted but not applied" roles worth pursuing
   - Prioritize by fit and deadline

5. **Priorities for the Week**
   - Top 2-3 actions
   - Key calendar items

6. **AI News (Optional)**
   - Offer to run `/ai-news` for interview talking points

### Step 4: Update Weekly Note

Update or create the weekly note with:

```markdown
# Week of [Date Range]

## Priorities

1. [Top priority]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## Calendar

- **[Day]:** [Event]

## Pipeline

| Role | Status |
|------|--------|
| [Role] | [Status] |

## Follow-ups

- [ ] [Task]

## Applications to Send

- [ ] [[Role Name]] — [Brief note]

## Networking Waiting

- [Contact] — [status]

## Notes

[Any market context or observations]
```

### Step 5: Update Job Hunting.md

If there are changes to record (new applications, status updates, moved items), update Job Hunting.md accordingly.

## Tips

- Keep it brief and actionable
- Don't duplicate — link to existing notes
- Focus on what's changed since last week
- Flag anything time-sensitive (deadlines, interview prep)
