# Analyze

Universal entry point for anything user shares — URL or pasted content. Detects input type, routes to appropriate handler or graceful fallback. One skill for all analysis.

## Workflow

1. **Detect Input Type**
   - Starts with `http://` or `https://` → URL, go to step 2
   - Otherwise → pasted content, treat as article (step 3)

2. **Fetch & Classify URL** — Get content, detect type from URL pattern + page structure

3. **Route** — Send to appropriate handler (specialized, lightweight, or fallback)

4. **Ontology Injection** — Before generating note, grep vault for existing tags/MOCs to use

5. **Save** — Write note with type-appropriate YAML frontmatter

6. **Log** — Append to telemetry for future optimization

## Content Type Detection

| Pattern | Type | Handler |
|---------|------|---------|
| `github.com/*/*` | repo | Lightweight |
| `linkedin.com/jobs/*` | job | → `/evaluate-job` |
| `linkedin.com/company/*` | company | Lightweight |
| `linkedin.com/in/*` | profile | Lightweight |
| `*.substack.com`, `medium.com/*`, `*blog*` | article | Specialized |
| `arxiv.org/*`, `papers.*`, `*.pdf` | paper | Specialized |
| `youtube.com/*`, `youtu.be/*` | video | → `video-digest` skill |
| `bilibili.com/*`, `b23.tv/*` | video | → `video-digest` skill |
| `xiaoyuzhoufm.com/*` | podcast | → `video-digest` skill |
| `podcasts.apple.com/*` | podcast | → `video-digest` skill |
| `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.m4a` direct links | media | → `video-digest` skill |
| Company career/about pages | company | Lightweight |
| Everything else | unknown | Check content, then fallback |

**Fallback logic:** If URL pattern unclear, fetch content and look for signals:
- Has "Key Ideas" / thesis structure → article
- Has job requirements / responsibilities → job
- Has code/commits/stars → repo
- Otherwise → unclassified

## Three-Tier Handlers

### Tier 1: Specialized (full evaluation)

**Articles** (URLs or pasted content):

Worth Noting check first:
| NOTE | SKIP |
|------|------|
| Novel ideas, frameworks | Marketing fluff |
| Relevant to work/interests | Paywalled with no content |
| Contrarian or well-argued | Beginner explainers |
| Actionable insights | News without insight |

If NOTE, choose depth based on content substance:

**Standard** (most articles) — quick vault note:
```yaml
---
source: [URL or "pasted content"]
type: article
author: [if known]
date_read: [today]
tags: []
---

## Key Ideas
- [3-5 bullets, dense, no fluff]

## My Take
[2-4 sentences: why this matters, connections, critique]
```

**Deep** (use when: content is long-form, technical, or user says "analyze deeply" / "deep analysis") — multi-dimensional breakdown. Scan all dimensions but only output those with actual content:

```yaml
---
source: [URL or "pasted content"]
type: article
author: [if known]
date_read: [today]
tags: []
analysis_depth: deep
---

## Summary
[1-3 sentence core thesis]

## Core Arguments
- **Thesis**: [Main argument or finding]
- **Evidence**: [Supporting data or reasoning]
- **Strength**: [How convincing? What's missing?]

## Tools & Methods
- [Tools, frameworks, or techniques mentioned — what they are, how applied]
- [Relevance to current work/projects]

## Workflow Ideas
- [Process improvements or automation opportunities from the content]

## Data & Numbers
- [Key metrics, trends, gaps in data]

## Risks & Warnings
- [Author's stated risks + blind spots + counter-arguments]

## Resources
- [Tools/APIs, people worth following, further reading mentioned]

## Mental Model Shifts
- **Before**: [Common assumption]
- **After**: [New understanding from this content]

## Action Items

### Quick wins (under 30 min)
- [ ] [Action] — Impact: high/med/low | Effort: easy

### Deeper work (1-3 hours)
- [ ] [Action] — Impact: high/med/low | Effort: medium

### Exploration (needs validation)
- [ ] [Action] — Impact: uncertain | Effort: hard
```

If SKIP:
> **Skip** — [reason]
> TL;DR: [2-3 sentence gist]

**Jobs** — Route to `/evaluate-job`

### Tier 2: Lightweight (basic extraction)

**Repos:**
```yaml
---
source: [URL]
type: repo
fetched_at: [timestamp]
language: [primary language]
stars: [count]
last_commit: [date]
license: [if present]
related_company: [if identifiable]
tags: []
---

## Overview
[1-2 sentence description from README]

## Signals
- **Activity:** [active/stale/abandoned based on commit recency]
- **Quality:** [docs, tests, CI badges]
- **Relevance:** [why this matters for interview prep / learning]
```

**Company Pages:**
```yaml
---
source: [URL]
type: company
fetched_at: [timestamp]
company: [name]
industry: [sector]
size: [if available]
stage: [startup/growth/enterprise]
tags: []
---

## Overview
[What they do, 2-3 sentences]

## Signals
- **Tech Stack:** [if mentioned]
- **Culture:** [any signals from about/careers]
- **Red Flags:** [if any]
```

**Profiles (LinkedIn):**
```yaml
---
source: [URL]
type: profile
fetched_at: [timestamp]
name: [person name]
role: [current title]
company: [current company]
connection_context: [why relevant - recruiter, hiring manager, etc.]
tags: []
---

## Background
[Brief summary of experience]

## Notes
[Why saving this profile - interview prep, networking, etc.]
```

**Videos / Podcasts:**
Route to `video-digest` skill for full transcription + structured digest. That skill handles YouTube, Bilibili, Xiaoyuzhou, Apple Podcasts, X video tweets, and direct audio files. After transcript is produced, apply deep analysis framework above if user requests analysis (not just transcription).

### Tier 3: Generic Fallback

For anything unclassified:
```yaml
---
source: [URL]
type: unclassified
fetched_at: [timestamp]
domain: [source domain]
tags: []
---

## Content
[Title and brief summary]

## Why Saved
[User's apparent intent - to review later, reference, etc.]
```

## Ontology Injection

Before generating any note, run:
```bash
grep -r "^tags:" ~/notes/*.md | cut -d: -f2 | tr ',' '\n' | sort -u | head -50
```

Also check for relevant MOCs:
```bash
ls ~/notes/*MOC*.md ~/notes/Maps/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

**Rule:** Only use tags that already exist in vault. Never invent new tags. If no existing tag fits, leave tags empty — better than fragmenting the graph.

## Telemetry

Append to `~/notes/Meta/Analyze Telemetry.md`:
```
| [date] | [input] | [detected_type] | [confidence] | [override?] |
```

Review weekly to see which content types need specialized handlers.

## Skip Conditions

Don't create a note if:
- URL is a login wall with no content
- Content is pure marketing fluff (announce and exit)
- Already exists in vault (check by URL)

For skips, output:
> **Skip** — [reason]
> Domain: [source]

## Edge Cases

**Hybrid content** (e.g., blog post about a repo): Ask user which type to prioritize, or create note with primary type and link to related.

**Paywalled:** Report clearly, offer to wait for user to paste content.

**Failed fetch:** Try WebFetch first, fall back to asking user to paste.

## Integration

This skill replaces `/evaluate-article`. Use `/analyze` for all content — URLs or pasted text.

`/evaluate-job` remains separate for LinkedIn job URLs — this skill dispatches to it for job posts.
