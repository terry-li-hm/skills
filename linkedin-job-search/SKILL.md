# LinkedIn Job Search

Reference skill for effective LinkedIn job searching.

## Search Strategy

**Broad vs Specific:**
- **Broad keyword + location** (e.g., "AI" + Hong Kong) — Better for discovery. Catches non-standard titles like "Product Lead - AI", "Strategy Manager, AI", "Principal Engineer (ML)".
- **Specific title alerts** (e.g., "VP Data Science") — Better for passive monitoring. Notifies when exact-match roles post.

Use both: broad search for weekly manual scanning, specific alerts for notifications.

## Filtering for Sponsorship (Overseas)

When searching for roles that might sponsor visas:
- Add keywords: "relocation", "visa support", "visa sponsorship"
- Filter by company size (larger companies sponsor more often)
- Check job description for "must have right to work" (usually means no sponsorship) vs silence on visa (might sponsor)

## Applicant Stats Interpretation

LinkedIn shows applicant seniority breakdown. Notes:
- 50% entry-level doesn't mean the role IS junior — juniors spray-and-pray on everything
- Low VP/Director % suggests senior people don't see this as a fit
- Use as one signal among many, not definitive proof of seniority level

## Saved Jobs

Use LinkedIn's "Save" feature to batch jobs for later review. See `/review-saved-jobs` skill for systematic review workflow.
