# Evaluate Job

Analyze LinkedIn job postings against user's background, current pipeline health, and career criteria. Output a recommendation (APPLY/CONSIDER/PASS) with structured reasoning.

## Workflow

1. **Navigate to job posting:**
   - **Primary:** `WebFetch` — fast, works for most JD content
   - **Fallback:** `agent-browser --profile` for logged-in view (applicant stats, seniority breakdown, salary source attribution)
   - Extract: company name, role title, requirements, responsibilities, preferred qualifications, salary if disclosed, applicant stats

   **WebFetch limitations on LinkedIn:**
   - Misses **applicant stats** (count, seniority breakdown) — requires being logged in
   - Cannot distinguish LinkedIn's estimated salary range from employer-disclosed salary. Mark any salary as `(LinkedIn estimate — not employer-disclosed)` unless the JD text explicitly states the range
   - If applicant stats or salary attribution matter, use `agent-browser --profile` (persistent login via `AGENT_BROWSER_PROFILE` env var)

2. **Check for duplicates and same-employer saturation** (before full analysis):
   - Search vault for existing note matching company + role (e.g., `[[*Role* - *Company*]]`)
   - Check [[Job Hunting]] "Applied Jobs" and "Passed On" sections for the company name
   - If match found:
     - Show user what was found (existing note, application status, date)
     - Ask: "Already evaluated/applied to [match]. Proceed with analysis anyway?"
     - If user says no, stop early — no further analysis needed
   - **Same-employer batch detection:** If 3+ roles at the same company have been evaluated (in vault or current session), flag it: "Multiple roles at [Company] — consider picking your strongest match rather than scatter-applying across the same division." This prevents diluted applications and signals desperation to recruiters who may see multiple apps.

3. **Load context files** (can run in parallel with step 1) — Check user's CLAUDE.md for background, credentials, differentiators, current situation, and job hunting status

4. **Analyze fit** across dimensions (see Fit Dimensions below)

5. **Factor pipeline health:**
   - **Healthy** (5+ active, interviews scheduled): Maintain standards — PASS on poor fits
   - **Thin** (<5 active, no interviews): Lower bar — CONSIDER "good enough" roles
   - Consider urgency of user's situation when weighing trade-offs
   - **Offer-signed hard filter:** When an offer is already signed, apply stricter competition thresholds — especially for roles requiring relocation. ~90+ applicants on a relocation role = auto-PASS regardless of credential match. The ROI of competing against 100 people when starting a new job in weeks is near zero.

6. **Check for red flags** (feedback loop from `/debrief`):
   - Review [[Job Hunting]] → Market Signals for relevant patterns:
     - **Objections:** What got pushback in similar roles?
     - **Wins:** What hooks landed that this role could use?
     - **Persona Mismatches:** Did similar roles expect different positioning?
   - Review [[Job Hunting]] → Anti-Signals for known rejection patterns
   - If role matches a pattern, flag it in analysis and factor into recommendation

7. **Output recommendation:** APPLY, CONSIDER, or PASS with clear reasoning
   - **Warm lead check:** If a warm lead exists at this company (check [[Job Hunting - Pipeline Archive]] → Warm Leads), do NOT suggest forwarding the job posting to the contact. That's transactional and undermines organic positioning. Instead, note the posting as **intel** (confirms the company is actively hiring for this type of role) — useful context for when the organic introduction happens, not a conversation starter.

8. **Review with Judge:**
   - Run evaluation through `/judge` with `job-eval` criteria
   - Check: fit_analysis, red_flags, specificity, recommendation, career_direction
   - If verdict is `needs_work`: revise analysis (max 2 iterations)
   - Ensures recommendation is specific and actionable, not vague

9. **Create vault note — MANDATORY for ALL outcomes:**
   - **Do this immediately after giving recommendation — don't wait for user to ask**
   - Filename: `[[Role Title - Company]]`
   - **MUST include full JD details:** Copy requirements, responsibilities, qualifications verbatim from the posting
   - Include: Fit analysis table, recommendation reasoning
   - This creates a record for future reference, pattern recognition, and duplicate detection

10. **Update job tracking:**
    - **APPLY:** Add to "Applied Jobs" or "To Apply" section in [[Job Hunting]]
    - **PASS:** Add to "Passed On" section with one-line reason
    - **CONSIDER:** Note in appropriate section with context

11. **If APPLY:**
    - **Easy Apply roles:** Ask whether to proceed with application now
    - **Company website roles:** Offer to help via `agent-browser --profile` (persistent login). For form filling, always check `~/notes/Personal Details for Applications.md` for correct name (李浩銘), address, and personal details. Note: Workday portals block Playwright actions on later form steps — use automation for login/upload/early steps, expect manual completion for dropdowns and submission.

## Fit Dimensions

| Dimension | Considerations |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Seniority** | Step up, lateral, or step down from current level? |
| **Role Focus** | Matches core skills (AI/ML, DS, etc.) or pivot (BI, PM, DE)? |
| **Industry** | Strategic value? Transferable credibility? |
| **Tech Stack** | Alignment with user's technical strengths? |
| **Competition** | Applicant count, seniority distribution, education levels |
| **Salary** | Compare to current compensation if known. For foreign currencies, **always use Python** for FX conversion — never mental math. Flag LinkedIn estimates vs employer-disclosed. |
| **Anti-Signal** | Does this match a known rejection pattern? |
