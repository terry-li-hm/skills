# AI News Sources Configuration
# All sources fetched by cron (cadence-gated). Tier controls display priority:
# Tier 1: Always surfaced in /ai-news
# Tier 2: Surfaced only if noteworthy, or in deep mode
#
# cadence: daily | twice_weekly | weekly | biweekly | monthly
#   Used by cron to skip sources unlikely to have new content since last fetch.
# rss: Direct RSS/Atom feed URL (preferred for cron — structured, reliable)
# url: Web page URL (fallback — needs HTML scraping)
