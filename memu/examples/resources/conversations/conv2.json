For nature, I'd recommend Golden Gate Park, hiking at Lands End, or visiting Muir Woods for the redwoods. For tech, you could do a self-guided tour of tech headquarters in Silicon Valley or visit the Computer History Museum. For your partner, there's the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park and SFMOMA for modern art."

This way you'll avoid the crowds and experience the peaceful atmosphere of the forest. The morning light filtering through the redwoods is also spectacular for photography. Make sure to book parking reservations in advance as they're required."

If you're in the Mission District, try Gracias Madre for organic Mexican food. For something casual, Ike's Love & Sandwiches has great veggie options."

You can run from the Ferry Building towards Fisherman's Wharf, which is about 3 miles one way. Alternatively, Crissy Field offers stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge. If you want something more challenging with hills, try running up to Coit Tower from North Beach."
