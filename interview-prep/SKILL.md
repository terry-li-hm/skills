# Interview Prep

Prepare for an upcoming interview by researching the company, pulling relevant stories, and matching experience to role requirements.

## Trigger

Use when:
- Terry has an interview scheduled
- Says "prep for [company]", "interview prep", "prepare for interview"

## Inputs

- Company name
- Role title
- Interview stage (if known: phone screen, hiring manager, technical, etc.)
- Interview date/time (optional)

## Steps

### 1. Read Context

- `/Users/terry/notes/CLAUDE.md` — personal context
- `/Users/terry/notes/Core Story Bank.md` — prepared stories (if exists)
- `/Users/terry/notes/Interview Preparation.md` — general prep notes (if exists)
- `/Users/terry/notes/Job Hunting.md` — check for notes on this role/company

### 2. Research Company

Use web search to gather:
- **Recent news** — last 3-6 months, anything notable
- **Tech stack** — what they use, especially data/ML infrastructure
- **Culture signals** — values, work style, reviews
- **Key people** — who Terry might meet, their background
- **Challenges** — what problems they're likely solving

Present a concise briefing (not a wall of text).

### 3. Role-Experience Mapping

Based on the job description (if available) or role title:

| Role Requirement | Terry's Relevant Experience |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| [Requirement] | [Matching experience/story] |

Pull from Core Story Bank where applicable.

### 4. Stories to Have Ready

Recommend 3-5 stories from Core Story Bank that are most relevant:
- Why this story fits
- Key points to emphasize for this company

If Core Story Bank doesn't exist or is sparse, note what stories Terry should prepare.

### 5. Questions to Ask

Generate 5-7 thoughtful questions:
- Role-specific (day-to-day, expectations, success metrics)
- Team/culture (how team works, collaboration)
- Company direction (strategy, challenges, growth)
- Avoid generic questions — tailor to research findings

### 6. Potential Concerns

Flag anything Terry should be ready to address:
- Gaps or transitions in background
- Why leaving current role (have a clean narrative)
- Salary expectations if likely to come up
- Any red flags from research

### 7. Save Prep Notes (Optional)

Offer to save prep notes to vault:
`/Users/terry/notes/Interview Prep - [Company].md`
