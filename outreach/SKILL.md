# Outreach

> **Note:** This skill has been merged into `/message`. Use `/message --type=warm` or `/message --type=cold` for the same functionality.

Draft personalized networking messages to contacts for job search.

## Trigger

Use when:
- Terry wants to reach out to a contact
- Says "draft outreach to [name]", "network with [name]", "message [name]"

## Inputs

- Contact name
- How Terry knows them (if not in vault)
- Purpose: catch-up, ask for referral, request intro, informational chat
- Channel: LinkedIn, email, WhatsApp (affects tone/length)

## Steps

### 1. Check Vault for Context

Look for the contact in:
- `/Users/terry/notes/Job Hunting.md` — networking section
- Any linked notes like `[[Contact Name]]`
- Search vault for mentions

Gather:
- How Terry knows them
- Last interaction
- Their current role/company
- Any shared history or mutual connections

### 2. Research Contact (if needed)

If not enough context in vault, offer to look up:
- Current role on LinkedIn (via web search)
- Recent activity or news
- Mutual connections or shared experiences

### 3. Determine Message Strategy

Based on purpose and relationship:

| Relationship | Approach |
|--------------|----------|
| Close contact | Direct ask is fine |
| Former colleague | Warm re-connection + ask |
| Weak tie | Value-first or soft ask |
| Cold contact | Need a hook (mutual connection, shared interest) |

### 4. Draft Message

Tailor to channel:

**LinkedIn** (keep short, ~100 words max):
- Brief context on connection
- Specific ask or reason for reaching out
- Easy call-to-action

**Email** (can be slightly longer):
- Subject line that gets opened
- Personal connection point
- Clear purpose
- Specific ask with easy next step

**WhatsApp** (casual, brief):
- Conversational tone
- Get to point quickly

### 5. Present Draft

Show the draft with:
- Suggested subject line (for email)
- The message
- Any notes on timing or follow-up

Ask Terry if he wants adjustments before sending.

### 6. Log in Vault

After Terry sends, offer to update Job Hunting.md:
- Add to networking section if not there
- Update last contact date
- Note the purpose/status
