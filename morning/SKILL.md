# Morning Review

Daily briefing to start the day with focus.

## Triggers

- "morning"
- "good morning"
- "gm"

## Steps

1. **Calculate today's date and day of week** (anchor: Jan 1, 2026 = Thursday)

2. **Check job hunting status**
   - Read `/Users/terry/notes/Job Hunting.md`
   - Note any pending applications, follow-ups due, or waiting items

3. **Check for scheduled events**
   - Look for interviews, calls, or deadlines in the pipeline
   - Check if any daily notes mention upcoming commitments

4. **Review yesterday's daily note** (if exists)
   - Path: `/Users/terry/notes/Daily Notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Look for incomplete items or carryover tasks

5. **Deliver a concise briefing**
   - Today's date and day of week
   - Top priorities / focus areas
   - Any time-sensitive actions
   - Keep it short — a quick summary, not a wall of text
