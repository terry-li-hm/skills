# Noon Reflection

Midday checkpoint — what shipped this morning, what's still open, and what matters this afternoon.

Lighter than `/morning` (no weather, health, inbox). Heavier than a `/wrap` (synthesises across sessions, not just the current one). The goal: arrive in the afternoon with intent, not momentum.

## Triggers

- "noon"
- "midday"
- "lunch check"
- "afternoon"
- "/noon"

## Steps

1. **Get current time** — run `date`. If it's before 11am or after 3pm, note this is a midday reflection run at an unusual hour but proceed anyway.

2. **Scan morning sessions** (the core value):
   - Run: `resurface search "" --days 1 2>/dev/null | head -100`
   - Filter mentally for today's morning (roughly 6am–12pm HKT)
   - Group prompts by session ID to understand what each session covered
   - Extract for each session: topic, key outputs/decisions, anything left open

3. **Read NOW.md** — `~/notes/NOW.md`
   - Note anything that was flagged as active this morning
   - Cross-reference against what sessions actually shipped

4. **Token budget** (brief):
   - Run: `ccusage daily 2>/dev/null | tail -5` or check `/status` if concerned
   - If budget is tight (<20% remaining), flag it — affects afternoon delegation strategy
   - If healthy, skip silently

5. **Synthesise**:
   - **Shipped:** What actually got done this morning (code, decisions, vault updates)
   - **Open loose ends:** Things discussed but not completed, or deferred with "fix next time"
   - **Unresolved decisions:** Naming choices, architecture questions, etc. that ended without conclusion

6. **Afternoon priorities** — ask Terry:
   - "What's the one thing that matters most this afternoon?"
   - Or if the session scan surfaces clear priorities (e.g., a half-done task, a pending delegate), propose 2–3 options

7. **File loose ends** — for each open item identified:
   - If it's a quick fix: add to TODO.md `someday` or `low-energy`
   - If it's a decision: add to TODO.md with "Revisit:" framing
   - Don't over-file — only items with real risk of being lost

## Output

Short prose. Two sections max:

**This morning:** What shipped, what's pending, anything unresolved.

**This afternoon:** 2–3 candidate priorities (inferred from session scan + NOW.md), or prompt if genuinely unclear.

**Example:**

> **Monday 2 Mar, 12:45pm**
>
> Solid morning. Shipped: nexis v0.2, hypha CLI, trama to crates.io, lucus (worktree manager), keryx published, expedio skill renamed. Haircut booked with Herman (Mar 10, 12pm).
>
> Two loose ends: keryx `--copy` clipboard broken on M3 (filed as someday), claude-code-system naming unresolved (consilium ran, no conclusion — filed for revisit).
>
> This afternoon: Capco AI Landscape doc needs finishing, or GARP quiz if you want something lighter. Token budget looks healthy — delegate-first still viable.

## Notes

- Don't re-surface items already resolved in NOW.md or clearly completed this morning.
- If morning was light (few sessions, few prompts), the output should be proportionally short.
- This is a transition ritual, not an audit. Keep it under 2 minutes to run.
