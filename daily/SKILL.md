# Daily Reflection

End-of-day reflection to capture job search progress, learnings, and mood.

## Trigger

Use when:
- End of day
- User says "daily", "reflect", "end of day", "daily note"

## Steps

1. **Get today's date** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

2. **Check for existing note** at `/Users/terry/notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

3. **Walk through each section** by asking Terry:

   **Job Search Activity**
   - What did you apply to today?
   - Any status updates on existing applications?
   - What's next in the pipeline?

   **Key Learnings**
   - Anything interesting you learned today?
   - New insights about job search, interviews, or target companies?

   **Tools/Skills**
   - Any new tools set up or skills practiced?

   **Mood Check**
   - How are you feeling? (1-5 or a word)

4. **Create or update the note** with this template:

```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD

## Job Search
- Applied:
- Status updates:
- Next up:

## Learnings
-

## Tools/Skills
-

## Mood

```

5. **Save to vault** at `/Users/terry/notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Notes

- Keep it conversational, not interrogative
- If Terry has nothing for a section, that's fine — skip or put "—"
- If note already exists, update rather than overwrite
